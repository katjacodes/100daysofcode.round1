    <h2>Using the <code>&lt;article&gt;</code> Tag</h2>
    <p>Figuring out how to use the different tags relating to chunks of written text is a challenge. So for today's coding challenge, I'm going to try and use both the <code>&lt;article&gt;</code> and the <code>&lt;aside&gt;</code> tags correctly (and a bunch of others, as you'll notice if you check the code for this page).</p>

    <h3>Why Use the <code>&lt;aside&gt;</code> Tag?</h3>
    <p>The <code>&lt;aside&gt;</code> tag allows you to ellobrate on information pertaining to the surrounding text without having to interrupt the flow of reading. So readers may just skip over the <code>&lt;aside&gt;</code> section and come back later. Although, to be fair, that will only fully work once I know how to style this part with CSS. But I'll get there. In addition, the <code>&lt;aside&gt;</code> tag is useful for people using assitive technology, such as screen readers. The tag indicates that the text it encloses is a side note, definiton etc., so the sudden change of subject does not end up leading to confusion.</p>

    <h2>Article or Section?</h2>
    <p> I still find it challenging to figure out whether I should use the <code>&lt;article&gt;</code> tag or the <code>&lt;section&gt;</code> tag in any given context. I chose the <code>&lt;article&gt;</code> one for this text based on the information I found in <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/difference-between-article-tag-and-section-tag/"> this post on Geeks for Geeks</a>. But I may be wrong. My guess is this will become easier the more I code and have to make that call. As a professionl language nerd, these nuances really matter to me. So knowing that they matter in coding as well makes my language nerd heart smile.</p>

    <h2>And Now What?</h2>
    <p>While writing just this short paragraph, I came across several other things I hadn't even thought about:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>Figuring out how to write code within the actual <code>&lt;code&gt;</code> tag and having it be recognized as content, not just another tag prompted me to begin learning more about how to write different characters, in this case &lt; and &gt;, in HTML. I came acros <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/charsets/ref_utf_basic_latin.asp">this list by w3schools</a>, an amazingly useful and comprehensive resource for HTML and beyond.</li>

    <li>Learning that there may be better ways of guaranteeing accessilibty than slapping an <code>aria-label</code> on everything. <a href="https://www.a11y-101.com/development/aria-label">This website about <code>aria-label</code></a> reminded me that it's much more useful to &quot;write clear copy instead of using <code>aria-label</code> as some sort of crutch to make a link accessible.&quot; I'm a writer. Should've known that. I do now.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Quality over Quantity</h2>
    <p>This concludes today's experiments in HTML tags. Better to explore a few in depth than throwing around a bunch whose use I don't really understand.</p>
