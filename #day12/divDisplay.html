		<h1>Evening</h1><br>
		<h2>by Rainer Maria Rilke<br>
		translated by Stephen Mitchell</h2></header>
	<br>
	<p>The sky puts on the darkening blue coat<br>
		held for it by a row of ancient trees;<br> 
		you watch: and the lands grow distant in your sight,<br>
		one journeying to heaven, one that falls;</p>
	<p>and leave you, not at home in either one,<br>
		not quite so still and dark as the darkened houses,<br>
		not calling to eternity with the passion of what becomes<br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a star each night, and rises;</p>
	<p>and leave you (inexpressibly to unravel)<br>
		your life, with its immensity and fear,<br>
		so that, now bounded, now immeasurable,<br>
		it is alternately stone in you and star.</p>
